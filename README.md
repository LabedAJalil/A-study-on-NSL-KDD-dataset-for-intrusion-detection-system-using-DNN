# A study on NSL KDD dataset for intrusion detection system using DNN

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security mechanism used to protect a computer network from malicious activity and unauthorized access to devices by generating reports to the administrator of the system. In our project, we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using a deep neural network (DNN-IDS). We apply our proposal on NSL-KDD (a benchmark dataset for network intrusion). We particularly study the performance of the model with both binary and multiclass classifications. The binary classification model aims at identifying whether network traffic behaviour is normal or anomalous whereas multiclass classification provides a more refined classification by determining the class to which traffic belongs (Normal, Denial-of-Service, User to Root, Probe, Remote to Local).
